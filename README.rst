Python Template Repo
====================

Python Template Repo aims to help you **quickly jumpstart new Python libraries with
integrated developer tooling to efficiently develop high quality and robust software.**
If you want to focus on developing open-source software without dedicating significant
time and effort on repo setup, try this template out!

Simply follow the "Getting Started" guides below. It is also easily configurable based
on your library's needs.

Motivation
----------

This template was driven from the desire to reduce the overhead in setting up and
maintaining Python libraries that follow software engineering practices (e.g., code
styling, unit testing, documentation). The target audience was originally developers
from the E3SM Project and LLNL Climate Program, but it can be used by anyone in the
open-source community!

The template is based on a common system design pattern integrated in `E3SM Project`_ post-processing tools (e3sm_diags, zppy, zstash, polaris), `xCDAT`_, and `PCMDI Metrics`_.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Set up the Python Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps below to get this repository tailored to your library.

1. On this page, click "Use this template" and "Create a new repository"

   .. image:: docs/_static/use-this-template.png

2. Clone your new repository

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO-NAME>

3. Update ``setup.py`` to replace ``python_template`` references with your project name
4. Rename ``/python_template``, ``python_template.py``, and ``test_python_template.py`` to
   your project name

2. Set up the Anaconda Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps below to get the Anaconda development environment set up for your
library. We recommend using `mamba`_ instead of ``conda`` because it is significantly
faster and more reliable.

1. Download and Install Anaconda (Mac OS & Linux)

   .. code-block:: console

       curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
       bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh

2. Update ``/conda-env/*.yml`` by follow each file's ``#TODO`` comments (don't worry, it's straightforward)

3. Create and activate the Conda development environment

   .. code-block:: console

      mamba env create -f conda-env/dev.yml
      mamba activate template-dev

.. _mamba: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

3. Set up the Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library's documentation is setup with `Sphinx`_ and `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme`_.

You just need to do a few things to get up and running:

1. Update ``README.rst``, ``AUTHORS.rst``, ``HISTORY.rst``, and ``/docs/index.rst`` as needed
2. Decide how to deploy the documentation. This step is left up to you based on your needs.
   Follow the instructions in the provided links.

   - Option 1: `Read the Docs`_
   - Option 2: `GitHub Pages`_ (via GitHub Actions)

.. _Read the Docs: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html
.. _GitHub Pages: https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/gh_workflow/

To build the documentation locally (useful for reviewing):

1. Activate the conda developer environment

   .. code-block:: console

      mamba activate template-dev

2. Build documentation

   - Option 1: ``make docs`` from the root of repo (also cleans up and opens docs in your browser)
   - Option 2: ``cd docs && make html``

.. _Read The Docs Sphinx Theme: https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

4. Set up Quality Assurance Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository includes quality assurance (QA) tools for code formatting (``black``,
``isort``), linting (``flake8``), unit testing (``pytest``), and optional static type
checking (``mypy``). These tools ensure that you can easily catch issues and follow good
Python practices without sacrificing energy on them. These tools are integrated in the `pre-commit`_ package as "hooks" that automatically run when committing changes to files.

To run these QA tools through ``pre-commit``:

1. Activate the conda development environment

   .. code-block:: console

      mamba activate template-dev

2. Install ``pre-commit`` hooks into the Git repository

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pre-commit install
      pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit

   - ``pre-commit`` will now run automatically on ``git commit``!

3. (optional) Run against all files

   - it's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only run on the changed files during git hooks)

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pre-commit run --all-files
      [INFO] Initializing environment for https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.
      [INFO] Initializing environment for https://github.com/psf/black.
      [INFO] Installing environment for https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.
      [INFO] Once installed this environment will be reused.
      [INFO] This may take a few minutes...
      [INFO] Installing environment for https://github.com/psf/black.
      [INFO] Once installed this environment will be reused.
      [INFO] This may take a few minutes...
      Check Yaml...............................................................Passed
      Fix End of Files.........................................................Passed
      Trim Trailing Whitespace.................................................Failed
      - hook id: trailing-whitespace
      - exit code: 1

      Files were modified by this hook. Additional output:

      Fixing sample.py

      black....................................................................Passed

Useful commands:

- Override ``pre-commit`` checks: ``git commit -m <MESSAGE> --no-verify``
- Run individual hook: ``pre-commit run --all-files <black|flake8|isort>``

Information on QA tools:

- `pre-commit`_ - "Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before
  submission to code review."
- `black`_ - "The uncompromising code formatter" that "will save time and mental energy
  for more important matters".
- `isort`_ - isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and
  automatically separated into sections and by type.
- `flake8`_ - A Python linter that checks Python code for style and syntax errors, and
  for enforcing a style guide with `PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_.
- `mypy`_ - A static type checker for Python. "Type checkers help ensure that you’re
  using variables and functions in your code correctly. With mypy, add type hints (PEP
  484) to your Python programs, and mypy will warn you when you use those types
  incorrectly."

5. Decide How to Distribute on Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways of distributing on Anaconda including:

1. Using `conda-forge`_ (recommended)
2. Managing your own `Anaconda channel`_ and uploading packages there

I recommend using `conda-forge`. "conda-forge is a GitHub organization containing
repositories of conda recipes. Thanks to some awesome continuous integration providers
(AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and TravisCI), each repository, also known as a
feedstock, automatically builds its own recipe in a clean and repeatable way on Windows,
Linux and OSX.""

Helpful Knowledge
-----------------

Reminder to Routinely Maintain the Software Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is generally good practice to maintain your software infrastructure. Here is a
routine software maintenance checklist. I recommend doing these before every new
software version release.

1. Maintain conda environment dependencies in `.yml` files
2. Update `pre-commit` hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yml`

How GitHub Actions is Used for CI/CD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository uses GitHub Actions to run the CI/CD build workflow. This workflow is
**automatically triggered** with **commits on pull requests to** ``main`` and **merging pull requests to** ``main``.

Jobs include:

1. Run ``pre-commit`` for formatting, linting, and type checking
2. Build conda CI/CD environment with different Python versions, build and install
   the package, and run unit test suite with ``pytest``

Here's an example of GitHub Actions in "action": https://github.com/tomvothecoder/python-template-repo/actions

*To save time and resources on build cycles, GitHub Actions has been configured to
automatically skip jobs instead of re-executing based on the files that are committed. For
example, if docs are committed then the unit tests will not run.*

Additional Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Feel free to modify the configuration for QA tools in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.cfg``
- You can also remove some or all the QA tools if you want (not recommended though).
  Just make sure to delete them from your Anaconda ``.yml`` files and remove their entries
  in ``pre-commit-config.yaml`` and their configs in ``pyproject.toml`` and/or ``setup.cfg``
